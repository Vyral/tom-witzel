Here in the Denver Metro area, we’re still in a seller’s market, although there has been downward pressure on home prices.

I’ve found that about **25% of sellers have been lowering their asking prices** due to a couple of factors: the shortage of inventory, as well as the upward pressure on interest rates.

**Currently, most rates are right around 4.75% to 4.85%**, though some lenders have bumped them up to 5%. The rise in interest rates came as a shock to most people, given that we’ve enjoyed sub-4% rates for the past 10 years. There is somewhat of an adjustment going on in the market.

Homes are still selling in about 30 days—**if they’re priced correctly**.

If you have any questions specifically pertaining to the market, please feel free to reach out to me. I hope to hear from you soon.
