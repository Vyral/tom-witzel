Today I’m joined by **Chris Presley, the owner of Epic Homes**. She took some time out of her day to tell us about her storied career and the path that led her to create her own home building business.

**She immediately knew home building was her passion when she began working as an accounts payable clerk for a home builder in Colorado Springs.** After working for another builder in Florida, she was able to move back to Colorado in 2005 and has been here ever since.

Chris has worked with Centex Homes and Meritage Homes, which provided her with some great opportunities to learn more about the home building industry—knowledge she still uses in her business today. She’s always had the desire to have her own home building company, but finally had the chance to do so in 2015.&nbsp;

Epic Homes’ flagship community is Anthem Highlands, which was started around a year ago. There are currently 92 home sites available, and the area includes a 32,000-square-foot recreation center, an elementary school, and beautiful views no matter where you look.

Though she’s already found great success with Anthem Highlands, **a home builder’s sigh****ts are always on the future,** and Chris has two new projects she’s looking forward to beginning. The one she shared with us is located in Aurora and will be called Painted Prairie. This community will be the center for entry-level homes that range from 1,150 square feet to over 2,700 square feet.&nbsp;

I’d like to thank Chris for giving us an inside look at her life as a home building business owner. If you’d like to reach her at Epic Homes, call **303-798-3742**, email **discover@liveepichomes.com**, or visit their website at [https://liveepichomes.com/.](https://liveepichomes.com/.)
