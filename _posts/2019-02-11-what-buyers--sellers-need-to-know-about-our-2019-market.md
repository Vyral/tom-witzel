I’ve heard a lot of different opinions about where our market is headed in 2019. Some people think a crash is imminent. Others believe we’ll keep going strong, but our rate of appreciation won’t be as high as it was in the past.&nbsp;

**Most likely, we’ll fall somewhere in the middle.** In my 20 years in the real estate business, one thing I’ve learned is that any home will sell—it’s just a matter of how long it will take to sell and at what price.&nbsp;

If you’re selling your home in 2019, you need to know that in any market, **there are three factors that matter most to buyers: price, condition, and location.**&nbsp;

Price is perhaps the most important factor in determining whether your home sells or not. If you price it too high, you’ll probably end up getting less for it than if you would’ve priced it correctly in the beginning. If your home sits unsold for many days on the market, agents will notice that, and they’ll wonder what could be wrong with it.&nbsp;

To price a home correctly, I do what appraisers do and price it based on comparable homes in the area that are similar in age and style. With this formula, I have a track record of getting between 96% and 98% of my sellers’ asking price.&nbsp;

When it comes to condition, many homeowners don’t put enough thought into preparing their home for the market. Some do too little, while others do too much. A few home improvements that buyers find very appealing and are also relatively inexpensive include:

* A fresh coat of paint on the front door, the entire exterior, or any set of steps that lead to an unfinished basement&nbsp;
* Touching up scratches and scuffs on the walls and baseboards
* Cleaning the carpet or having new carpet installed
* Cleaning and servicing the furnace, air conditioner, and hot water heater

If you think your home needs remodeling, give me a call. I’d love to take a look at what rooms you’re thinking of, hear your ideas, and offer my advice as to whether it’s a good value or not. Kitchens and bathroom are the two areas with the highest rate of return in terms of remodeling.&nbsp;

If your home is on the market during wintertime and there’s snow on the ground, another simple improvement you can make is to simply clear your sidewalks and driveway. During springtime, you need to make sure your front yard looks good. Adding fresh flowers by the front steps is always a nice touch.&nbsp;

How your home’s location impacts its days on market and eventual sale price depends on a few different things. If it backs up to a golf course, a park, or an open space, that’s very beneficial. If it backs up to a busy street or a commercial building, on the other hand, that can be a drawback. In fact, that kind of feature can decrease your final sale price by as much as 20%.&nbsp;

**If you’re thinking of buying a home in 2019, I believe it could be one of the best times to buy in recent years.** There will be more inventory available, and while interest rates have risen lately, they’re still historically low. When I bought my first house in 1993, my interest rate was 6.5%. When I bought my third house in 2016, my interest rate was 3.875%. As of January 3, rates were hovering around 4.5%.&nbsp;
