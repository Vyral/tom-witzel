There’s a lot of buzz in the media these days about how technology can solve all our problems, cost less, and bring us a better outcome. While technology can certainly help us save time, make decisions, and even allow us to bring you messages like this very blog post, it cannot by itself bring us salvation.

For example, certain professionals like attorneys, accountants, financial advisors, Realtors, lenders, and similar owe their clients a fiduciary duty, meaning that their advice and actions should prove that they have their clients’ best interests at heart. 

I’m certain that most of us have had both good and bad experiences with all of these professions. **As a Realtor, I have fiduciary duties to my clients; brokers must exercise reasonable skill and care for sellers and buyers, including, but not limited to, the following:**

* Performing the terms of any written or oral agreement with the seller or buye
* Presenting all offers to and from a seller or buyer in a timely manner, regardless of whether the property is subject to a contract for sale
* Disclosing to sellers and buyers any adverse material facts that I’m aware of
* Advising sellers and buyers regarding the transaction, as well as advising them to obtain expert advice regarding material matters about which the broker knows but isn’t specifically trained to handle
* Accounting for all money and property received in a timely manner
* Keeping the buyer and seller fully informed of the details of the transaction
* Promoting the interests of the buyer or seller with the utmost good faith, loyalty, and fidelity
* Seeking a price and terms that are set forth in the contract
* Counseling the buyer or seller to any material benefits or risks of a transaction that I’m aware of.

**Additionally, I must not disclose the following information without the informed consent of the buyer or seller:**

* That the seller is willing to accept less than the asking price for a property
* That the buyer is willing to pay more than the asking price for the property
* The motivating factors prompting the seller to sell or the buyer to buy
* That the seller or buyer will agree to financing terms other than those offered
* Any material information about the seller or buyer, unless disclosure is required by law or failure to disclose such information would constitute fraud or dishonest dealing
* Suspicions regarding circumstances that could psychologically impact or stigmatize the property

These duties are taken directly from the contracts that Realtors are required to use that have been prepared by the Colorado Real Estate Commission and their attorneys.

I bring this up today in order because I’m sure that you have received, as I have, letters from companies that claim to take the hassle out of selling or buying a home. Doubtless, you have also heard that Zillow will buy and finance your next home purchase hassle-free.

**With all these claims these companies make, I fail to see how these companies can have your best interests in mind**. A home purchase is most likely the largest financial transaction you’ll make in your lifetime—don’t leave it to some company that owes you no fiduciary duty.
