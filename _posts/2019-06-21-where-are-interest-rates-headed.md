Interest rates are a hot topic in the market today, so I recently sat down with financial expert Zephra Clement of Home Mortgage Alliance to learn more about where rates are headed.&nbsp;

According to Zephra, **the Fed has announced several times that they don’t have any future rate hikes planned for the time being.** And given that rates are still incredibly low right now, this is great news.&nbsp;

Of course, global economic factors, like Brexit and the trade war with China, are also at play. So, we’ll definitely be keeping our eye on how those things develop.&nbsp;

**For now, though, interest rates are in a great spot.** It’s become much more affordable to buy a home than once was the case, and local lenders like those at Home Mortgage Alliance can make the process very simple.&nbsp;

As a joint venture with RE/MAX Alliance, Home Mortgage Alliance offers loan programs designed for buyers of every budget. Zephra says that if you’ve heard of a loan program, Home Mortgage Alliance almost certainly offers it.&nbsp;

And Home Mortgage Alliance does more than simply present you with options. Once they’ve matched you with a loan product that suits your needs, **they’ll make sure you are fully pre-approved so that you can continue on your home search with confidence.&nbsp;**

The entire lending process through Home Mortgage Alliance is very convenient, as well. For example, they offer online lending services to buyers who may not have the time to meet face-to-face.&nbsp;

“It’s really important to me that the process is smooth and seamless,” says Zephra. She and her entire team at Home Mortgage Alliance are extremely committed to providing top-notch customer service. When you work with Home Mortgage Alliance, you can rest assured that your lending needs are in good hands.&nbsp;
