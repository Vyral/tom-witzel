Most people have heard of title insurance, but not everyone knows exactly what it is.&nbsp;

Essentially, title insurance policies protect the policyholder against potential disputes of ownership. Other types of insurance require the policyholder to pay someone else to hold liability for potential risk; but with title insurance, the risk is eliminated from the beginning.&nbsp;**Title insurance guarantees ownership and that no outstanding discrepancies will arise.&nbsp;**

Essentially, when it comes time for a buyer to take over ownership of a home, the title agent will gather and record the necessary documentation, transfer ownership to the buyer, and then, of course, issue the policy.&nbsp;

Also, **unlike other kinds of insurance, title insurance is paid for with a one-time fee rather than an ongoing premium.**&nbsp;

There are many kinds of title companies and agents available, with the main disparity between them being their ability to pay claims. The job of a quality title company is to search for and uncover any potential liens, and then to eliminate risk prior to transfer. In addition to this, title companies are also tasked with generating a deed.&nbsp;
