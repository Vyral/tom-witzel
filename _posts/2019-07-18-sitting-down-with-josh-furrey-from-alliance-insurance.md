Today I’m sitting down with Josh Furrey from Alliance Insurance for an illuminating discussion about homeowners insurance. Here are a few highlights from our conversation: &nbsp;

***Q. Alliance Insurance is an independent agency. What does that mean exactly?***&nbsp;

* Being independent, we’re able to choose what insurance companies we do business with. As of now, we have about 10 preferred carriers, including some of the larger, more renowned companies like Chubb and Private Client. We also have carriers for policyholders who’ve had too many claims and don’t qualify as “preferred.” Another bonus of being independent is that we can shop rates every term to give our clients the most affordable option.&nbsp;

***Q. Aside from auto and homeowners insurance, what lines of insurance do you carry?***

**A.** We do personal umbrella insurance and a small variety of business insurance—specifically for preferred clientele. Essentially, we offer all forms of insurance under the sun with the exception of health insurance.&nbsp;

***Q. Clients often ask, “Tom, why are insurance rates rising?” I’m less-than-qualified to answer that, so why are they rising?&nbsp;***

**A.** Every year since 2009, we’ve had a horrific hail storm tear through our area, not to mention the tornado that hit Windsor. Right now, the insurance industry is about a year behind and scrambling to determine how they’re going to improve profitability for next year. When you see news coverage of a hailstorm, you can bet your bottom dollar that rates will subsequently go up. If we could have just one year where we aren’t hit with hail, rates would start to flatten out, I think. &nbsp;&nbsp;

***Q. When it comes to shopping for homeowners insurance, what is a CLUE report and what will it tell us? &nbsp;&nbsp;***

**A.** The acronym “CLUE” stands for a Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange. Its purpose is to pull losses on a property you’re interested in, and it will also pull losses on you individually. The combination of which will be factored into the amount of premium you’ll pay. My best advice is to know what you’re looking at up front as a homebuyer so you won’t end up with a mess on your hands. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

***Q. As consumers, is there anything we can do to lower our risk and insurance costs?&nbsp;***

**A.** Sure. In the past, I offered a lot of comprehensive insurance to homeowners. Nowadays, there’s more of a need and a greater emphasis on catastrophic-related coverage. In light of that, you can start lowering your costs by scaling back some of your coverage that you wouldn’t file a claim for.&nbsp;
