It’s time again for another update on our Denver metro area market.

While we’re beginning to see a modest increase in inventory, demand for new listings is still high, which is making multiple-offer situations the norm across our market. **Homes aren’t receiving multiple offers with the same frequency as a few years ago, but buyer demand is still outpacing our supply.**&nbsp;

Now, this doesn’t mean the bottom will fall out of the market. **I simply see this as a sign that our market is balancing out.&nbsp;**

**Interest rates are down by about 0.5% from where they were early in 2019**, and by all accounts, the Fed plans to lower rates even further by sometime in July of this year. Just last week, I closed on a home for one of my buyers, and we were able to secure a 3.625% rate for them on a conventional loan with 20% down. Suffice it to say that rates are falling, and in some cases, they’re in the sub-4% range. &nbsp; &nbsp;

Given current conditions, **is it a good time for you to buy or sell?**

That depends on your specific situation right now, but technology is a major facilitator in helping us get the answer. For my part, **I have access to technological tools that allow me to look back over a four-year period to determine how our present market is doing in comparison.**

If you’re interested in finding out if now’s a good time for you to take action in our market or you have any other real estate-related questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me by phone at 303-808-2206 or by email at [Tom@TomWitzel.com.](Tom@TomWitzel.com) I hope to hear from you soon\!&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
