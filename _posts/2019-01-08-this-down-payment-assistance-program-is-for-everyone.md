Financing is a critical aspect of the real estate process, and today I’d like to share some insight on one program in particular: the Colorado Housing and Finance Authority’s down payment assistance program (or CHFA).&nbsp;

To better explain this program, I recently sat down for a discussion with local mortgage professional Margaret Skrbina of MegaStar Financial—which you can follow along with in the video above.&nbsp;

According to Margaret, **this program is for all buyers, not just those making a home purchase for the first time.** That said, there are a few stipulations.&nbsp;

Buyers must have a credit score of 620 or higher and have an annual income at or below $115,000.&nbsp;

**There are two different ways to use this loan:**

Buyers may either take a grant equalling 4% of the loan amount to apply toward their down payment, or they may take the 5% “silent second” mortgage option.&nbsp;

The first option, the grant, does not need to be paid back. The second option, the silent second mortgage, provides the buyers with 5% of the loan amount—an amount which remains at a 0% interest rate for 30 years. Unlike the 4% grant, **the silent second mortgage loan does need to be repaid, but only after the buyer either refinances or sells the home.**&nbsp;

As a final requirement, the CHFA program does also stipulate that buyers must put forward a minimum of $1,000 toward the transaction. CHFA does not stipulate, however, where these funds come from. Gift money can be applied.&nbsp;

Best of all, CHFA works with any and all available loan types, making it a great financing solution for all buyers.&nbsp;

You can get in touch with Margaret to discuss this program in greater depth by giving her a call at (720) 313-3634.&nbsp;

And, as always, if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
