When spring rolls around each year, we all get the urge to tackle some home improvement projects. Many homeowners are under the impression that for every dollar they spend on their home, they’ll get that dollar back when they go to sell, and this popular, yet faulty, belief is further aided by shows you’ll see on HGTV. &nbsp;

Unfortunately, this isn’t the case.&nbsp;

In my 20 years as a real estate professional, a cost versus value guide is published year in and year out, and **it lists what you can expect in average cost and average return per improvement at the national, regional, and local levels of the housing market.** Consider working off this guide as you prepare your home for the market.

One common improvement that homeowners undertake is finishing their basement, believing this will add a tremendous amount of value. Although a finished basement does add some value, it’s not as rewarding as you might think.&nbsp;

Appraisers estimate that the value-add tends to be $15 to $20 per square foot, depending on the kinds of improvements you make. **It’s important to take into account the cost of the improvement, though;** this obviously isn’t a wise investment if you spent $100 per square foot. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

If you are thinking about finishing your basement before you sell, here are a few highly sought-after improvements by buyers you can add that will give you the best ROI for the cost:&nbsp;

* A three-quarter or full bathroom&nbsp;
* A bedroom with an egress window
* Additional living space &nbsp; &nbsp;

If you’d like a copy of that cost versus value guide, please give me a call at 303-808-2206 or send me an email at **Tom@TomWitzel.com**. Or if I can help you with anything else related to your real estate needs, you’re welcome to also reach out. I look forward to hearing from you\!&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
