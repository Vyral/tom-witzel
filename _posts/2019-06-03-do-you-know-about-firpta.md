If you’ve bought or sold a home recently, you may be familiar with FIRPTA. If you haven’t, you probably have never heard of it. FIRPTA is a tax on the sale of real estate in the United States by foreign individuals.&nbsp;

This is important because it’s an IRS tax code and it makes the buyer ultimately responsible for withholding the tax if a seller is a foreigner. **There are some exemptions to this tax for foreign sellers, but I would encourage you to reach out to your tax accountant to see if you are exempt from it.**

The tax rate on this witholiding can be substantial, **up to 10% to 15% depending on the sale price.** The IRS views the buyer in this case as the withholding agent, however, in all practicality, the title companies withhold the proper amount, remit that to the IRS, and they have 20 days in which to do so.&nbsp;

This is all in the 2019 Colorado real estate contract, so if you’re thinking of buying or selling a home and you have questions, it’s imperative to reach out to a Realtor and title company who are experienced in these matters.

If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
