The other day, someone asked me if buying a home is still the best way to gain financial independence. My answer was obviously yes.

Normally in our Denver-area market, your home will gain about 4% to 6% in appreciation each year. Over the last few years, though, we’ve seen increases closer to 9% or 12%—this is clearly not a normal market.

**But what does appreciation do for us?**

Well, if we continue to pay down the mortgage, we’re really saving for retirement. With the combination of the increase in price and the drop in your mortgage, you’ll be in a very good equity position. &nbsp;If you can get your mortgage paid off, you’ll have one fewer large expense to pay during your retirement years

An easy way to pay off your mortgage sooner is to make one extra house payment per year. By doing this, you’ll essentially turn a 30-year mortgage into a 23-year mortgage, meaning you’ll have more money at retirement age. It’s also a good way to force yourself to save money.

If you have any questions or would like to discuss the market, don’t hesitate to give me a call or to send an email. I’d love to hear from you.<br>&nbsp;
