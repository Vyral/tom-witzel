This morning Iâ€™d like to thank you all for your support over the years. It would be impossible to do what I do without you. As you gather with family and friends this Thanksgiving, I hope you have time to stop and think about all that we have been blessed with. I wish you the best and I hope your Thanksgiving is joyous and wonderful.
