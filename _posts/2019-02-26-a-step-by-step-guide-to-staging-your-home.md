To stage your home so that it sells in the quickest amount of time and for the highest possible price, there are several steps you must take.&nbsp;

First, you have to **declutter**. If you have any items you don’t use on a daily basis just sitting around on your countertop, put them away. If you have a home office, put all your documents away and make your desk look neat and tidy. In your closets, remove any clothes and/or coats that aren’t in season and pack them up.&nbsp;

Next, you need to **depersonalize the home**. You don’t sell a home the same way you live in it, so you need to temporarily remove any personal pictures and other things of that nature.

You also need to examine your floors. Does the carpet need cleaning? If you have hardwood floors, do they need refinishing? If your basement is unfinished, do you need a fresh coat of paint on the steps leading to the basement?&nbsp;

Next, **look at the home’s exterior and check its curb appeal**. The landscaping, for example, should look neat, tidy, and healthy. You need to spruce up the outside so you make the best first impression possible. As we know, you never get a second chance at a first impression.&nbsp;

Your overall goal is to make your home look like a model home, and there are plenty of simple, inexpensive things you can do to achieve this effect. Try putting some fresh flowers out on the tables, baking some cookies to create a nice aroma, or turning on all the lights so everything is nice and bright. Make sure your home’s temperature is nice and cozy, as well—not too cold or too hot. Having some nice music playing in the background wouldn’t hurt, either.&nbsp;

Potential buyers should want to linger in your home for about half an hour. You want them to start imagining how their furniture and other belongings would look in your home. Speaking of furniture, if a room feels crowded to you, it probably is. You want wide open pathways and rooms that look as large as possible.&nbsp;
