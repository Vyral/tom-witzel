I was at my chiropractor's office the other day and he was asking me about the market, which got me thinking that I haven’t had a market update for you all in a while. Today’s I’d like to bring you the latest news.

He mentioned to me that houses were starting to take longer to sell and wanted to know if we were in a market downturn. **My response to him, and to you, is that no we are not.** We are seeing an increase in inventory, which is a very welcome sight after years of an extremely limited supply of homes that created bidding frenzies. Things were getting a little out of whack with all the multiple-offer situations and the offers that were way above list price.

Today, the number of our active listings and under-contract listings are up, while sold listings are decreasing a bit. **His observation was correct that days on market are going up, but that’s simply due to buyers having more choices available to them.&nbsp;**

Right now, interest rates are a little over 4% for a 30-year fixed mortgage, and under 4% for a 5- to 7-year ARM. If we look at the last 60 years, the average rate is around 8%, so we’re still about 50% below that.

If you’d like some more exact numbers about the number of listings, sales, and more in your neck of the woods, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
