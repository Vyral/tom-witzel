Today I’m here with one of my preferred lending partners, Dennis Marshall of Commerce Home Mortgage, and we'll be discussing key points about what’s going on in the current marketplace that you should be aware of.

**The numbers from the Denver Metro Association of Realtors came out yesterday, and we learned a few important things:**

1. The average number of homes on the market rose from August to September, as compared to our historical average. Between 1985 and 2017, there were just a bit over 16,000 homes on the market on average; today, we have about 8,800.
2. Prices did come down for single-family homes, with the average price now slightly over $502,000.
3. For attached single-family homes, condos, and townhouses, the average sold price is about $347,000.

With the number of homes on the market having increased from August to September, many people are wondering what’s going on. In my opinion, **it’s due to the economy getting better. Wages are starting to increase and people are feeling a bit more comfortable in the real estate market.**

Dennis has a different interpretation of what you might have heard on the news lately regarding the interest rates:

Interest rates are at a seven-year high. Roughly a year ago, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was somewhere around 4%. Today it’s closer to 5%, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s recent announcement. That means that every $100,000 a homeowner borrows in today’s market is about $60 more a month for the principal and interest than it was last year.

**This doesn’t mean that rising rates should scare you, but rather put things in perspective.** Interest rates are still at historical lows, and there are numerous programs that exist to help people with their down payments.

The mortgage application volume did increase over the last two weeks, and that’s a positive sign as well, factoring in wage increases, a solid economy, and consumer confidence across the United States.

If you are thinking of buying a home in this market, **the No. 1 thing to do is reach out to a professional to get a good feel for what’s actually going on in the marketplace.** What you hear on the news misrepresents how drastic the situation actually is. It’s still a great time to buy a home, especially now that there is more than double the inventory in our current market over what we saw last year.
