**One of the best ways to help with your home’s energy-efficiency is to first focus on your windows and doors.** If they’re old, it might be time to consider replacing them. Technology has entered every phase of our lives, and it also applies to building products. The windows and doors available today are much more energy-efficient than even those of the 1990s.

Next, take a look at your insulation to see if it’s either time to completely replace it or to add some to what already exists, whether it be batting or blown-in insulation.&nbsp;

**Having your furnace cleaned and serviced will certainly help with the heating and cooling of your home.** If your furnace is older than 20 years, it’s probably a good time to start looking for a new one. Depending on the time of year you shop for new furnace and/or air-conditioning units, you might be able to find heating contractors who run specials from time to time.

An overlooked improvement that will help your home to be more energy-efficient is the thermostat. There are several different programmable thermostats on the market these days that can help you save energy and program different settings throughout your home. **Many of these can even be controlled from your smartphone.**

Use these tips to help you live in comfort and to save money on your utilities each year. If you have any questions about this topic, specific energy-efficient products, or contractors, feel free to reach out to me. I’d love to help.
