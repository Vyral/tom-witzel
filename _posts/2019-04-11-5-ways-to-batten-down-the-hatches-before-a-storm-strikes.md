Today I want to spend a little time discussing how to prepare your home for the worst storms and how to make sure the aftermath doesn’t continue to cause your property damage.

1. **Contact your insurance agent to be sure your coverage is current.** It would be truly unfortunate if a storm damaged your home in a way that wasn’t covered by your current policy.
2. **Double check that your siding is secured.** Additionally, make sure that your doors and windows are properly caulked/sealed against the elements.
3. **Have a professional assess your roof.** We have been known to get some horrendous winds, which can damage the exterior of your property—especially your roof. A professional can check to see if your roof is missing any shingles or is otherwise unworthy to withstand a storm.
4. **Properly secure loose patio furniture.** If you have a barbecue grill or other furniture on a patio or deck, be sure that those items are secured or put away before a storm strikes.
5. **Ensure that your garage door and remote are in working order.** When the blizzard hit, the wind was so strong that my garage door wouldn’t go up again\!

Even though spring is a beautiful time of year, it can also bring unpredictable weather patterns. Take the time to make sure your home is secure and properly maintained so that you can protect the largest investment that you have.
